# About
EdgeR is fetishware that continuously spames the user with image, video, and audio popups of thier choice at a customisable rate. This project is insipred by [Edgeware](https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware) and I only ended up building it because there were some things about Edgeware I wanted to change/fix and didn't know anything about python. EdgeR is more or less just clone with much better UI and a few extra quality of life chnages such as beig able to pause and resume popups from the system tray.
