# About
EdgeR is a project insipred by [Edgeware](https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware) that I built because there were some things about Edgeware I wnated to change/fix and didn't know how tf python works. EdgeR is more or less just clone with a few less features thats a **lot** easier to use. I will add more stuff to it in the future to hopfully make it just as good or better than Edgeware but for now im very happy with this since I went into it with 0 idea on how to make a desktop application.
